# EzCob
AFK auto-clicker for a cobblestone generator

So this is pretty easy to use, just open up Minecraft, then open up EzCob.exe
answer the prompts as to what pick(s) you will be using and how many, then it will give a count-down
in the 10 seconds it gives you, you just gotta open up the Minecraft window, and get in position to mine the cobble.

Litterally that's it.

I doubt anyone will see this anyways, but if you do, feel free to ask me if you have any questions.
